# About Me

Welcome to my blog! I'm Carlos, a passionate individual from Almería currently living in Alcorcón. Here, I share my thoughts on various topics including technology, sports, and history. My goal is to create a space where I can connect with others who share similar interests.

## What You'll Find Here

You'll find posts about my experiences in technology, insights on the pharmaceutical distribution industry, and maybe even some reflections on my journey toward retirement.
